## Full Stack Software Developer

Hello, I am a software developer with expertise in developing full stack dynamic web applications with Python and Javascript. I pursued my education in computer science at Code Fellows and have been honing my skills ever since.

Prior to my career in tech, I worked as a carpenter, developing skills that have proven to be invaluable in my current profession, such as attention to detail and problem-solving.

Additionally, I am a US army veteran who served from 2011-2015. I am based in Renton, WA and eager to continue growing my knowledge and contributing to the industry.
